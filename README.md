<br>
Welcome to the One Piece Arc Analysis repository! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to analyze the relationship between the number of manga chapters and the corresponding number of episodes in the One Piece anime series. The model aims to predict the number of episodes for future arcs based on the entered number of manga chapters.<br>
<br>
Purpose<br>
The primary purpose of this project is to showcase the application of machine learning in predicting the number of episodes for One Piece arcs. It serves as a demonstration of how machine learning models can be utilized to analyze and make predictions based on existing data.
<br><br>
Disclaimer<br>
It's important to note that this model is created purely for fun and educational purposes. The accuracy of the predictions generated by this model is very low due to the limitations of the dataset used. The dataset consists of a small sample size and may not encompass all the variables that affect the episode-to-chapter ratio in the One Piece series.<br>
<br>
Usage<br>
To use the model, follow these steps:<br>
<br><br>
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:<br>
<br>
bash<br>
Copy code<br>
```git clone https://github.com/junaidakhtarsiddiqui/One_Piece_Arc_Analysis.git```<br>
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can use pip to install the necessary packages:<br>
<br>
Copy code<br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```<br>
Launch the model and provide the number of manga chapters for which you want to predict the number of episodes.<br>
<br>
The model will utilize the available data to generate a predicted number of episodes for the given manga chapters.<br>
<br>
