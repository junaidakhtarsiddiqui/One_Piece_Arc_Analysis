One Piece Arc Analysis
Welcome to the One Piece Arc Analysis repository! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to analyze the relationship between the number of manga chapters and the corresponding number of episodes in the One Piece anime series. The model aims to predict the number of episodes for future arcs based on the entered number of manga chapters.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to showcase the application of machine learning in predicting the number of episodes for One Piece arcs. It serves as a demonstration of how machine learning models can be utilized to analyze and make predictions based on existing data.

Disclaimer
It's important to note that this model is created purely for fun and educational purposes. The accuracy of the predictions generated by this model is very low due to the limitations of the dataset used. The dataset consists of a small sample size and may not encompass all the variables that affect the episode-to-chapter ratio in the One Piece series.

Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/junaidakhtarsiddiqui/One_Piece_Arc_Analysis.git
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can use pip to install the necessary packages:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the model and provide the number of manga chapters for which you want to predict the number of episodes.

The model will utilize the available data to generate a predicted number of episodes for the given manga chapters.

Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the model or expanding the dataset, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that any changes align with the fun and educational nature of this project.
